Online Book Store is a static web application designed to showcase and manage books categorized by departments like CSE, ECE, and AIML. It features a framed homepage with a header, welcome message, and footer. Users can navigate through pages such as Login, Catalogue, and Registration. The catalogue page displays book details in a tabular format including cover image, author, publisher, price, and "Add to Cart" buttons with interactive alerts. The registration page includes a fully functional JavaScript validation system ensuring inputs like name, email, phone, and password are properly checked. Core web technologies used include HTML, CSS (for layout and animation), JavaScript (for interactivity, prompts, alerts, validation), and HTML Frames for multi-section page layouts.
